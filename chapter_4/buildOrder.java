 * the projects to be built.
 * If there is no valid build order, return an error
 * Example :
 * 		INPUT
 *			projects : a, b, c, d, e, f
 * 			dependencies : (d,a), (b,f), (d,b), (a,f), (c,d)
 *		OUTPUT : f, e, a b, d, c

/**
 * O(P+D) time (P - projects, D - dependencies)
 * Nodes with no incoming edges can be built immediately

 *  / | \		d

 *    a  |
 *    |  /
 *    | /
 *    e
 *
 * 1. Add the nodes with no incoming edges. 
 *	  If the set of projects can b ebuilt, there must be some "first" project,
 *	  and that project can't have any dependencies. If a project has no dependencies
 * 	  (incoming edges), then we can't break anything by building it first
 *
 * 2. We removed all outgoing edges from these roots. Once those root projects were built
 *	  it doesn't matter if another project depends on them.
 *
 * 3. We found nodes that now have no incoming edges. Using the same logic from steps 1 and 2
 *	  It's okay to build these, find nodes with no dependencies, add them to build order
 * 	  remove their outgoing edges, and repeat
 *
 * 4. What if there are nodes remaining, but all have dependencies (incoming edges)? 
 *	  This means there's no way to build the system. We should return an error
 * 
 *  
 * 1. Build a graph where each project is a node and its outgoing edges 
 * represent the projects that depend on it. That is, if A has an edge to B
 * (A->B), it means B has a dependency on A and therefore A must be built before B.
 * Each node also tracks the # of incoming edges
 * 
 * 2. Initialize a buildOrder array. Once we determine a project's build order, we add it to the array.
 * We also continue to iterate through the array, using a toBeProcessed pointer to 
 * point to the next node to be fully processed.
 * 
 * 3. Find all the nodes with 0 incoming edges and add them to a buildOrder array. 
 * Set a toBeProcessed pointer to the beginning of the array.
 * 
 * Repeat until toBeProcessed is at the end of the buildOrder
 * 
 * 1. Read node toBeProcessed.
 *  >> If node == null, then all remaining nodes have a dependency and we have detected a cycle
 * 2. For each child of node:
 *  >> decrement child.dependencies (# of incoming edges)
 *  >> if child.dependencies is 0, add child to end of buildOrder
 *
